            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello, my name is Michael Lin. I graduated from UCR with a degree in Economics and was working as a Senior Accounting 
                Specialist. I had decided to make a change in career paths and to challenge myself. I have only taken 1 course in High 
                School, AP Computer Science, and I loved it. After listening to my friends and relatives about how awesome being a 
                developer is, I had decided to quit Accounting and pursue this with my fullest attention. Now I am currently a student 
                at UCLA FullStack Web Development Bootcamp. My goal is to obtain a position with an opportunity to grow and to pursue 
                knowledge in a challenging and professional work environment, and also being able to collaborate and work with 
                colleagues to solve difficult and important tasks.
            </p>
            <p>   
                I was born in Boston, Massachusetts. My family and I moved to California when I was around 8 years old. I am fluent
                in both languages, English and Chinese (Cantonese). I consider myself a very goal orientated and self-motivated
                individual. When I have something in mind, I tend to put my 100% effort into achieving it. I love solving puzzles
                and riddles which brings me back to High School when I developed codes and watched how each individual line of code
                functioned. I am a really adaptable and punctual person. I hate being late and I tend to get anxiety if I do.
                There is a quote that I absolutely love and I expect myself to fulfill this every day.
                "To be early is to be on time, to be on time is to be late, to be late is unacceptable."
                I'm also experienced in Softwares such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>  
            <p>  
                Other than coding, some of my hobbies are playing video games, playing volleyball, casually drinking with friends
                and colleagues, watching korean dramas, and listening to k-pop. When it comes to video games, I get very competitive.
                I'm not considered a professional when it comes to video games but I can humbly say that I would be better than average.
                I had attended several competitve mid-tier tournaments throughout my life and had actually won a few with a small prize 
                pool. For volleyball, I played the middle position although I am only 5'10. I had an insane vertical so my coach decided
                to play me as the middle position. I thought this was halirious because every school we fought had a middle with an average
                of 6'4 or higher. We ended up winning the championship in our league and actually made it to the CIF quarter-finals.
                When it comes to drinking with friends and colleagues, I do not hold back. I like to drink and casually talk about life,
                work, and anything in general. It brings out my extrovert within me. I have only recently gotten into korean dramas and K-pop.
                After both my grandparents passed away in 2021 from covid, I felt depressed. Korean dramas and K-pop had brought me both 
                laughter and smiles. My favorite k-pop bands are BlackPink, Twice and Itzy.
