<h1 align="center"> Journey As A Developer </h1>

<h2 align="center"> Project Description </h2>
<p align="center"> This project will navigate and track all my projects I had worked on throughout my journey as a developer. As I continue to grow and develop to be a professional developer, this page will continue to grow as well. The motivation in making this project is to have future employer's get a sense of my work and to evaluate whether or not I am a good candidate for the position; therefore, this project is an extremely important piece of work to represent myself. I learned a lot creating this project from styling my portfolio, including hyperlinks that navigates to the corrosponding section, links to my work and much more. This project is also user interface friendly as it is available for all devices such as mobile, tablets and computers.
